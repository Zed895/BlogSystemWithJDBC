# BlogSystemWithJDBC
JDBC version of a blogsystem as a hobby project in Java, SpringBoot. 

This is a simple blogsystem in Java, SpringBoot. I created this hobby project to practice what I learnt on the Java course at sanfranciscoboljottem.com. The stories and bloggers are stored in H2 and 
PostgreSQL databases. Search functions for stories or bloggers are implemented in this first version. Used technologies: Java, Maven, Spring Boot, JDBC, H2 and PostgreSQL databases.
